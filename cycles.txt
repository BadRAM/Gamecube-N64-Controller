Code flow for transmit segment of get_gc_status

.L7 - top of outer loop body

 3 cycles to set up inner for loop

.L3 - top of inner loop body

 2 cycles to bring the line low

 7 cycles for condition setup
  2 cycles for 1 bit condition, continue below
  3 cycles for 0 bit, and jump to .L4

___ - bit was a 1 conditional branch (low 1us, high 3us)

 * nop block 1, 9 cycles since LOW, need
 * 16-9-2=5 nops

 2 cycles to set the line high

 * nop block 2
 * want 16 cycles remaining after the jump to .L5
 * 16*2 - 2 = 30 nops

 2 cycles to jump to .L5

.L4 - bit was a 0 conditional branch (low 3us, high 1us)
 
 * nop block 3
 * 10 cycles since LOW, needs
 * 3*16 - 10 - 2 = 36
 * more cycles

 2 cycles to set the line to high

.L5 - after the conditional, line needs to stay high for 16 more cycles

 1 cycle to rotate out bits
 1 cycle to subtract
  1 cycle to continue below and eventually continue the inner loop
  2 cycles to jump to .L6

 * nop block 4
 * after this block, line goes low in 4 cycles
 * above this block, there were 3 cycles
 * 16 - 4 - 3 = 9 nops

 2 cycles to jump to .L3, top of inner loop body

.L6 - bottom of outer loop

 2 cycles to save r18 and increment Z pointer
 2 cycles to compare (optimize if needed, why is it doing a word compare?)
  2 cycles to exit outer loop
  3 cycles to jump to .L7, top of outer loop body

___ - end of transmit loop, send a stop bit

 * nop block 5
 * 6 cycles until the line is scheduled to go low

 2 cycles to lower the line

 * nop block 6, wait 1us (16 cycles) and then raise the line (2 cycles)
 * so 16 - 2 = 14 cycles
